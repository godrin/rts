/**
   \brief Base class for application - holds the main loop
   \ingroup application

  Use AGApplication as base class your application's class.
  In this library it's assumed that you have different parts of your program, that
  are really different. Each of these parts has its own AGApplication.
  The actual control of these applications is done through a main-loop, that
  queries new events from libSDL and gives them to the correct widgets.
  This main-loop can by started by run(). After this your have some possibilities to access
  control. FOr instance there are the different event* functions, which you can override in
  an AGApplication's subclass.

  If you want to quit this application call tryQuit().

  Each AGApplication has a single main-widget, which is drawn in every frame.
  Set it by calling setMainWidget().

  The typical usage looks like this:
  <pre>
  class MyApp:public AGApplication
  {
    public:
    bool eventFrame(float t)
    {
      std::cout<<"In this frame "<<t<<" seconds have passed."<<std::endl;
    }
  };

  int main()
  {
    // here you have to init the video mode
    AGMain main;
    main.initVideo(800,600,32,false,false);

    // the actual example
    MyApp app;
    app.run();
    return 0;
  }
  </pre>
